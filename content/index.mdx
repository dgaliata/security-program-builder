# Introduction

## Why This Project Exists

When I first got into cybersecurity one thing I struggled with was how to build an entire program from scratch. I didn't know where to start. The landscape was overwhelming, dozens of frameworks, hundreds of controls, and rapidly growing advancements such as AI.

That's why I started this project: to document and share what I've learned about building well rounded, vendor agnostic security programs that work in today's AI driven world.

## What This Project Provides

The **Cybersecurity Program Builder** offers a framework for organizations developing security programs in the AI era. It combines proven cybersecurity practices with emerging AI security controls, providing actionable guidance across governance, privacy, risk management, and compliance.

This project integrates:
- **Traditional Security Controls** based on industry standards (NIST, ISO, OWASP)
- **AI-Specific Security Requirements** for modern ML/AI systems
- **DevOps Integration** with infrastructure-as-code and automation
- **Practical Implementation Guidance** with templates and examples

<Callout type="info">
This is a living document that evolves with the cybersecurity and AI security landscape. Community contributions help keep it current and comprehensive.

## Who This Is For

- **Security Leaders** building or enhancing security programs
- **DevOps Engineers** implementing security-by-design practices
- **AI/ML Teams** needing security guidance for AI systems
- **Compliance Professionals** mapping controls to regulatory requirements
- **Consultants** helping organizations improve their security posture

## Project Structure

This project covers the following comprehensive program areas:

### **Foundation Programs**
- **[Governance Program](/governance-program)** - Organizational governance structures for cybersecurity and AI risk management

## Getting Started

Ready to build your security program? Each program area builds upon the others, but you can start with any section that matches your current priorities.

**Recommended Starting Points:**
- **New to security programs?** Start with [Governance Program](/governance-program)
- **Existing security program?** Jump to [AI-specific programs](/ai-model-lifecycle-management)
- **DevOps focused?** Explore the DevOps integration sections in each program area

Each section provides foundational concepts, practical implementation guidance, and ready-to-use templates to help you build a robust, modern security program.
